# school-projects
projects from my time at university. 
Projects included are a rock-paper-scissor game.
array war, were the user enters numbers for an array, that is then spit into two arrays, and even number and odd number array, shuffles them, and then compares the positions 
in the array to see which array has the bigger number, and adds them to a new array. Finally, the array with all the winning numbers is printed out.
pig latin: takes a string from the user and converts it to pig latin.
horse race: tries to simulate a horse race with a basic gui.
two binary tree programs: one just being a simple one and the other finding things such as max depth.
